Student Behavior Analysis Using Deep Learning
Project Overview
This project aims to analyze student behavior using deep learning techniques. It consists of four key modules:

Data Extraction: Collecting raw data from various sources.
Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and normalizing the data.
Feature Extraction: Identifying meaningful patterns and features.
Deep Learning Model: Training and evaluating the model for behavior prediction.
Features
Automated data handling and cleaning.
Advanced feature selection techniques.
Robust deep learning model for prediction.
Comprehensive analysis and results visualization.
